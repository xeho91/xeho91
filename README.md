## Technology Stack

### Operating systems

#### <img alt="Linux logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/TuxFlat.svg" /> Linux

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer, I was starting to learn more about the concept of **[Open-source model and open collaboration]**. By the time I grew, I started to love this movement and I am slowly migrating myself to **use only Open Source technologies**. Besides that, this platform plays a crucial role in software development, servers. For my aspirations to be a full-stack developer, I mainly focus on this operating system.

##### Distributions

Normally, I use "headless" Linux _(via terminal)_. I am familiar with these following **distributions** so far:

###### <img alt="Ubuntu logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg" /> Ubuntu

At first, in my learning journey, I started with **[Ubuntu]**. I found it to be the most beginner-friendly one. Now, I am using this distribution mostly for the servers where I need to install or configure quickly. With the configurations made in advance, it can save some time.

###### <img alt="Debian logo" height="12" src="https://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd.svg" /> Debian

When I decided to focus on Open Source technologies only, I picked **[Debian]** as my main distribution to use, because it's the most common one used by other developers. I found it easy to use with having a previous experience with `Ubuntu`.

###### <img alt="ArchLinux logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Archlinux-icon-crystal-64.svg" /> Arch Linux

The deeper I dug into expanding my knowledge about Linux, I have found out about **[Arch Linux]**. I totally identified myself with its five principles: simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. **I am about to start using this distribution as my core for developing purposes**.

#### <img alt="Windows logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Windows_logo_-_2012_%28dark_blue%29.svg" /> Windows 10

From time to time, I'm in need to use Adobe tools, such as `Illustrator`, `XD`, `Photoshop`, etc. It is impossible for now to use Adobe products on Linux platforms, even with the replacements _(`GIMP`, `Inkscape`, etc)_. Sometimes, there is other GUI software which is available only on popular operating systems such as Windows or Mac, which gives me another reason to keep using it. Luckily, Microsoft had a "change of heart" in the past years with its own contribution and focus on Open Source. They started to care more about the developers and they are providing a **[Windows Subsystem for Linux]** _(`WSL`)_ environment which I use.

### Terminals

#### <img alt="Windows Terminal logo" height="12" src="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/res/terminal/Terminal.svg" /> Windows Terminal

On Windows 10 I use **[Windows Terminal]**. In my opinion is very user friendly, customizable and easy to use with any shells available on my Windows or Linux _(via `WSL`)_.

### Shells

#### Zsh

**[Zsh]** _(TBA my thoughts)_


#### Bash

**[Bash]** _(TBA my thoughts)_

### Editors

#### <img alt="Neovim logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Neovim-mark-flat.svg" /> Neovim

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**, because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's very fast. With a proper configuration, it can have some  IDE features, and after some time of training, it definitely made me more productive and less dependant on the GUI editors.
Although I have to warn you that the learning curve to learn how to use this editor is very steep. It takes a time to understand this editor, and as well how to configure plugins on your own _(requires an understanding of `VimScript` aka `VimL`)_.

#### <img alt="Visual Studio Code logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg" /> Visual Studio Code

For debugging purposes, I use **[Visual Studio Code]** because this editor is easier to use for this and is more advanced. I use it also when I need to code with a quick preview of the results. For example an `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS, `Markdown`, etc. _(with the help of plugins)_. To keep the consistency _(with keybindings and mappings)_ in using both of these editors, I use **[VSCodeVim plugin]**.
