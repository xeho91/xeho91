## About me

As my short biography says, I'm a **concerned Global Citizen** passionate about
the life below the oceans and sustainable development.

Below I will share a little more about me in AMA style format _(Ask Me
Anything)_.

### Why a Global Citizen?

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

Because I do explore the world as much as possible.
As [Thor Heyerdahl] once said:

> Borders? I have never seen one.\
> But I have heard they exist… in the minds of some people.

Like him, I don't see the borders.
I was born in Poland, but my home is Earth and I care about entire planet.
I treat every habitant equally, without any discrimination.
I have been living in Poland, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan, Ireland already,
and I don't plan to stop on discovering other cultures and their lifestyles.
Is quite astonishing to me how little I knew,
if I didn't start to discover/experience with my own eyes.

### What makes me concerned?

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

As as child,
I used to watching nature and wilderness documentaries on Sundays from BBC
station with [David Attenborough].
Mostly from the _[The Blue Planet]_ series.
It was my sort of meditation watching the scenes of natural wilderness,
especially with this calm voice, that kept my curiosity high and in awe.

Few years later,
influenced by [TEDx talk from Sylvia Earle] I got "punched" damn strong by how
we have failed as humanity to take a better care of the blue part of our world.
Since then I decided to monitor the situation by following the news from the
NGOs and other respected marine biologists.
From what I see, there has been some progress,
however I'm still left with a lot of concerns that we are not making enough to
improve it.
It frustrates me that I'm not yet capable to help more with this.

Hence why there comes my passion for the life below the oceans and
sustainable development.

### What is my work experience?

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

Having an academical experience in the digital marketing,
I have self-taught myself how to become a software developer with focus on the
full-stack.
I didn't stick just to working in the IT industry.
On the contary.
I volunteered on many projects since I was a student and a long member of the
international student organization - [AIESEC].
I worked in a farms, packhouses, warehouses.
I did housekeeping in hospitality businesses and worked as kitchen porter in
the restaurant.
I did help exchange quite often.
Occassionaly I helped remotely with graphic design errands as well as online
promotion campaigns or websites development.
I did anything at the expense of allowing me discover as much as possible in
this world and what it has to offer.

### What type of adopter I am?

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

By common definitions, I am either **Innovator** or **Early Adopter**.
I don't take a pride in in being first to test/use new technologies or products.
I do like to test them, try to find their potential and provide a feedback.
Naturally, I pick them with caution and understanding.
I don't try to be an opinion leader, neither become a influencer.
I carefully select them from the IT industry.

## My technology stack

Below you can find the technologies I am familiar by having any experience with
them.
I also allowed myself to share some thoughts about them,
mostly to remind myself why I pick these or why I use it.

### Operating systems

#### <img alt="Linux logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/TuxFlat.svg" /> Linux

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Linux</summary>

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer,
I was starting to learn more about the concept of **[Open-source model and open
collaboration]**.
By the time I grew,
I started to love this movement and I am slowly migrating myself to **use only
Open Source technologies**.
Besides that, this platform plays a crucial role in software development,
and servers administration.
For my aspirations to be a full-stack developer,
I mainly focus on this operating system.

</details>

##### Distributions

Normally, I use "headless" Linux _(via terminal)_.
I have worked with these following **distributions** so far:

###### <img alt="Ubuntu logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg" /> Ubuntu

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Ubuntu</summary>

At first, in my learning journey, I started with **[Ubuntu]**. I found it to be
the most beginner-friendly one. Now, I am using this distribution mostly for
the servers where I need to install or configure quickly. With the
configurations made in advance, it can save some time.

</details>

[ubuntu]: https://ubuntu.com/

###### <img alt="Debian logo" height="12" src="https://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd.svg" /> Debian

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Debian</summary>

When I decided to focus on Open Source technologies only, I picked **[Debian]**
as my main distribution to use, because it's the most common one used by other
developers. I found it easy to use with having a previous experience with
`Ubuntu`.

</details>

[debian]: https://www.debian.org/

###### <img alt="ArchLinux logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Archlinux-icon-crystal-64.svg" /> Arch Linux

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Arch Linux</summary>

The deeper I dug into expanding my knowledge about Linux, I have found out
about **[Arch Linux]**. I totally identified myself with its five principles:
simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility. **I am
about to start using this distribution as my main one**.

### <img alt="Windows logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Windows_logo_-_2012_%28dark_blue%29.svg" /> Windows 10

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Windows Terminal</summary>

From time to time, I'm in need to use Adobe tools, such as `Illustrator`,
`XD`, `Photoshop`, etc. It is impossible for now to use Adobe products on
Linux platforms, even with the replacements _(`GIMP`, `Inkscape`, etc)_.
Sometimes, there is other GUI software which is available only on popular
operating systems such as Windows or Mac, which gives me another reason to
keep using it. Luckily, Microsoft had a "change of heart" in the past years
with its own contribution and focus on Open Source. They started to care more
about the developers and they are providing a **[Windows Subsystem for
Linux]** _(`WSL`)_ environment which I use.

### Terminals

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Windows Terminal</summary>
  
  On Windows 10 I use **[Windows Terminal]**. In my opinion is user friendly,
  customizable and easy to use with any shells available on my Windows or Linux
  _(via `WSL`)_.

</details>

### Shells

#### Zsh

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Zsh</summary>

As the main shell for everyday tasks or projects, I use **[Zsh]**. It's
extending `Bash` with more features and there are lots of available Open
Source tools or plugins to allow me being more productive, with my own
configurations.

</details>

[zsh]: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/

#### Bash

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Debian</summary>

From time to time I use **[Bash]** as this is usually the default shell
available and being run when connecting to a server. For this reason, I do my
own "Shell scripting" in Bash's syntax, as it can be used cross-shell.
Another reason is that I can use [`ShellCheck`] for linting my own scripts to
deal with errors or possible security issues.

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on PowerShell</summary>

Once a while, I have to do some automation with file management on Windows or
other tasks related to the usage of this operating system. I found
**[PowerShell]** to be a perfect fit for this purpose. I use it as well for
testing projects which are supposed to be cross-platform.

### Editors

#### <img alt="Neovim logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Neovim-mark-flat.svg" /> Neovim

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Neovim</summary>

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**, because I can use it directly from the
terminal and it's quite fast. With a proper configuration, it can have some
IDE features, and after some time of training, it definitely made me more
productive and less dependant on the GUI editors. Although I have to warn you
that the learning curve to learn how to use this editor is steep. It takes a
time to understand this editor, and as well how to configure plugins on your
own _(requires an understanding of `VimScript` aka `VimL`)_.

</details>

#### <img alt="Visual Studio Code logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg" /> Visual Studio Code

<details>
  <summary>Expand my thoughts on Visual Studio Code</summary>

For debugging purposes, I use **[Visual Studio Code]** because this editor is
easier to use for this and is more advanced. I use it also when I need to code
with a quick preview of the results. For example an `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS,
`Markdown`, etc. _(with the help of plugins)_. To keep the consistency _(with
keybindings and mappings)_ in using both of these editors, I use **[VSCodeVim
plugin]**.
