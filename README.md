## Technologies I use

### Operating systems

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer, I was starting to learn more about the concept of **[Open-source model and open collaboration]**. By the time I grew, I started to love this movement and I am slowly migrating myself to **use only Open Source technologies**.

Normally, I use "headless" Linux _(via terminal)_ and I am familiar with these distributions so far:
- <img alt="Debian logo" height="12" src="https://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd.svg" /> **[Debian]**
- <img alt="Ubuntu logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg" /> **[Ubuntu]**

#### <img alt="Windows logo" height="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Windows_logo_-_2012_%28dark_blue%29.svg" /> Windows 10

From time to time, I'm in need to use Adobe tools, such as `Illustrator`, `XD`, `Photoshop`, etc. It is impossible for now to use Adobe products on Linux platforms, even with the replacements _(`GIMP`, `Inkscape`, etc)_. Sometimes, there is other GUI software which is available only on popular operating systems such as Windows or Mac, which gives me another reason to keep using it. Luckily, Microsoft had a "change of heart" in the past years with its own contribution and focus on Open Source. They started to care more about the developers and they are providing a **[Windows Subsystem for Linux]** _(`WSL`)_ environment which I use.

### Editors

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**, because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's very fast. With a proper configuration, it can have some  IDE features, and after some time of training, it definitely made me more productive and less dependant on the GUI editors.
Although I have to warn you that the learning curve to learn how to use this editor is very steep. It takes a time to understand this editor, and as well how to configure plugins on your own _(requires an understanding of `VimScript` aka `VimL`)_.

For debugging purposes, I use **[Visual Studio Code]** because this editor is easier to use for this and is more advanced. I use it also when I need to code with a quick preview of the results. For example an `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS, `Markdown`, etc. _(with the help of plugins)_. To keep the consistency _(with keybindings and mappings)_ in using both of these editors, I use **[VSCodeVim plugin]**.
