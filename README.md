## üßë‚ÄçüíªAbout me

As my short biography says, I'm a **concerned Global Citizen** passionate about
life below the oceans, because of this also about sustainable development.\
Since a while,
I have dug myself into the topic of **digital privacy rights on the Internet**.
That includes protecting ourselves and the small businesses who are
unconsciously at risk.

Below I will share a little more about me in
<abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> format.

### Why a Global Citizen?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Because I do explore the world as much as possible.
  As [Thor Heyerdahl] once said:

  > Borders? I have never seen one.\
  > But I have heard they exist‚Ä¶ in the minds of some people.

  Like him, **I don't see the borders**.
  I was born in Poland, but my home is Earth,
  and I care about the entire planet.
  I treat every habitant equally without any discrimination.
  I have been living in Poland, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Ireland.
  I don't plan to stop discovering other cultures and their lifestyles anytime
  soon.
  Is quite astonishing to me,
  how little I knew,
  if I didn't start to experience with my own eyes.

### What makes me concerned?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  As a child,
  I used to watching nature and wilderness documentaries.
  On Sundays from BBC station with [David Attenborough] as a presenter or
  narrator.
  Mostly from _"[The Blue Planet]"_ series.
  It was my sort of meditation watching the scenes of natural wilderness,
  especially with this calm voice, that kept my curiosity high and in awe.

  A few years later,
  **influenced by a [TEDx talk from Sylvia Earle],
  it got into my head how we as humans have disappointed to take better care of
  our world's blue part**.

  Since then,
  I decided to monitor the situation by following the news from the
  NGOs and other respected marine biologists.
  From what I see, there has been some progress.
  However,
  I still have lots of concerns that we are not making enough to improve it.
  It frustrates me that I'm not capable enough to help more with this case.

  I am also concerned that **I noticed an alarmingly increasing trend of
  breaking privacy rights on the Internet** with my digital marketing
  experience.
  This matter is still relatively new to me,
  and if I had to recommend where to start looking to expand this topic,
  I could recommend this one [TEDx talk from Andy Yen].
  It sparks the idea of current problems.

  For me,
  security and privacy are crucial for any organisation size now more than ever.
  I can notice that the awareness of this situation is slowly improving.
  However,
  I am not satisfied with the progress's speed because some damages may be
  irreversible.

### What is my work experience?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  After having an academic and practical experience in digital marketing,
  **I have been resiliently learning about software development, security,
  and accessibility**.
  I was mostly focusing on full-stack,
  to help small businesses adopt the technologies to their needs in a secure
  and private-oriented way.

  However, I didn't stick just to working in the IT industry.
  On the contrary.
  I volunteered on many projects since I was a student and a long member of the
  international student organisation - [AIESEC].
  I worked on farms, packhouses, warehouses.
  I did housekeeping in hospitality businesses,
  and as a kitchen porter in the restaurant.
  I have participated in help exchange quite often, mostly through [HelpX].

  Occasionally I helped remotely with graphic design errands and online
  promotion campaigns or websites development.
  I did anything to allow myself to discover as much as possible in this
  world.
  And what it has to offer.

</details>

### What type of adopter, I am?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  By standard definitions, I am **Early Adopter**.
  I don't take pride in being the first to use new technologies or products.
  I like to research them,
  try to find their potential and provide feedback.
  Naturally, I pick them with caution and understanding.
  It suits my interest in software researching.
  While I do that,
  I pay attention to privacy and security depending on the software purpose.
  
  I don't try to be an opinion leader, neither become an influencer.
  I carefully select my _"own circle"_ of them from the
  <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> industry and the
  marine world.
  In modern times,
  I am doing my best to not fall into the trap of being misinformed.

## üíªMy technology stack

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer.
I learned more about the concept and the purpose of [Open-source model and
open collaboration].
By the time I grew, I have identified myself with this movement's idea.
**I started using Open Source technologies or tools, whenever possible**.

Below you can find the technologies I am familiar with by having any experience.
I also allowed myself to share some thoughts about them,
mostly to remind myself why I pick these or why I use it.

### Operating systems

I have experience with two popular operating systems.
[Linux] and [Windows].
I wanted to be oriented in both systems,
to be more flexible with what resources I have available,
at any time.

[Windows]: #windows
[Linux]: #linux

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Linux</summary>

  **This platform plays a crucial role in software development and servers
  administration**.
  For my aspirations to become a full-stack developer,
  I mainly focus on this operating system.
  Because this one is a [UNIX-like] system,
  I don't leave myself utterly unprepared for working with macOS or some
  electronic devices, including smartphones.

  Usually, I use Linux `"headless"` _(via terminal)_.
  I have worked with below-described **distributions** so far.

  [UNIX-like]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like

##### Ubuntu

<img alt="Ubuntu logo"

/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Ubuntu</summary>

  At the beginning of my learning journey,
  I started with [Ubuntu].
  I found it to be the most beginner-friendly one.
  Now,
  **I am using this distribution mostly for the servers** where I need to
  install or configure quickly.
  With easy access to the available resources and provided tools in advance,
  it can save time.

  [Ubuntu]: https://ubuntu.com/
</details>

##### Debian

<img alt="Debian logo"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/debian.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Debian</summary>

  When I decided to focus more on Open Source technologies only,
  I started to work with [Debian], especially on my Raspberry Pi.
  Thanks to the previous experience with `Ubuntu`,
  I was able to find myself in it.
  And learn more about the history behind it,
  because it helps to understand other Debian-like distributions.

##### Kali Linux

/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Kali Linux</summary>

  Because I use <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> on Windows,
  I decided to use this one distribution as the main one.
  [Kali Linux] provides the configured and installed tools for advanced
  penetration testing.
  Experience from `Debian` helped to get started with this one.
  It also offers `Win-Kex` tool,
  which allows using Linux and Windows application, at the same time.\
  This combination allows me to study better the differences between these
  operating systems.
  And of course,
  do some coding or software researching,
  without worrying about any tool working only on the specific operating system.
  Performance is still an issue,
  but I found it acceptable for not so _"resource-consuming"_ tasks.

##### Arch Linux

<img alt="Arch Linux logo"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/arch-linux.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Arch Linux</summary>

  The deeper I dug into expanding my knowledge about Linux,
  I have found out about [Arch Linux].
  I totally identified myself with its five principles:
  simplicity,
  modernity,
  pragmatism,
  user centrality,
  and versatility.\
  **I'm about to start using this distribution as my main one for the
  development**.
  I am still in the learning process.

#### Windows

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Windows 10</summary>

  Since Microsoft has changed its philosophy - _"to focus more on open-source"_,
  they started to care more about the developers' experience.
  By providing tools such as [Windows Terminal], [Windows Subsystem for Linux],
  <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</abbr> editor, etc.
  With the power of Open source,
  they managed to fix many faults,
  making it a much more friendly system for the coders.

  However,
  **this system's default settings, bloatware,
  manipulative marketing patterns and confusing approach to user's privacy
  still leave many areas to improve and leaves me concerned and suspicious**.
  No matter how comfortable using this system matures,
  I will keep my alert and suspiciousness,
  to any new features or tools.

  For the reason that is the most commonly used operating system,
  I use it to be more resourceful for the average user or any small company.
  Another reason is that some existing professional
  <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> software tools are
  available for this system only,
  such as Adobe tools.

<!-- ### Shells

It also allowed me to understand the Command Line Interface (CLI) and shell
scripting. Right now, I can't live without CLI tools, since they're my
productivity boosters.

#### Zsh

    />
    My thoughts on Zsh
  </summary>

As the main shell for everyday tasks or projects, I use **[Zsh]**.
It's extending `Bash` with more features,
and there are lots of available Open Source tools or plugins to allow me being
more productive, with my own configurations.

</details>

#### Bash

    />
    My thoughts on Bash
  </summary>

There are the moments when I use **[Bash]** as this is usually the default
shell available and when connecting to a server with Linux.
For this reason, I do my own "Shell scripting" in Bash's syntax,
because I can use it cross-shell _(with `Zsh`)_.
Another reason is that I can use [`ShellCheck`] for linting my own scripts to
deal with errors or possible security issues.

    My thoughts on PowerShell
  </summary>

Once a while,
I do some automation with the files management on Windows.
Or other tasks related to the usage of this operating system.
I found **[PowerShell]** to be a perfect fit for this purpose.
I use it as well for testing projects which are supposed to be cross-platform.

### Editors

#### Neovim

    />
    My thoughts on Neovim
  </summary>

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**,
because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's quite fast.
With a proper configuration, it can have some IDE features.
After a few months of training,
it definitely made me more productive and less dependant on the GUI editors.

I have to warn you.
The curve in learning how to use this editor was steep for me.
It took me a while to understand this text editor,
and as well how to configure plugins on my own _(requires an understanding of
`VimScript` aka `VimL`)_. It was worth it for me!

#### Visual Studio Code

    />
    My thoughts on Visual Studio Code
  </summary>

For debugging purposes, I use **[Visual Studio Code]**.
Because this editor is easier to use and provides more advanced possibilities.
Sadly, at the expense of performance.
I use it also when I need to code with a quick preview of the results.
For example, an `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS, `Markdown`, etc. _(with plugins, of
course)_.

To keep the consistency, with keybindings and mappings,
in using both of mentioned editors, I use **[VSCodeVim plugin]**.
