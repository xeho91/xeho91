## üßë‚ÄçüíªAbout me

As my short biography says, I'm a **concerned Global Citizen** passionate about
life below the oceans, because of this also about sustainable development.\
Since a while,
I have dug myself into the topic of **digital privacy rights on the Internet**.
That includes protecting ourselves and the small businesses who are
unconsciously at risk.

Below I will share a little more about me in AMA style format _(Ask Me
Anything)_.

### Why a Global Citizen?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Because I do explore the world as much as possible.
  As [Thor Heyerdahl] once said:

  > Borders? I have never seen one.\
  > But I have heard they exist‚Ä¶ in the minds of some people.

  Like him, **I don't see the borders**.
  I was born in Poland, but my home is Earth,
  and I care about the entire planet.
  I treat every habitant equally without any discrimination.
  I have been living in Poland, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Ireland.
  I don't plan to stop discovering other cultures and their lifestyles anytime
  soon.
  Is quite astonishing to me,
  how little I knew,
  if I didn't start to experience with my own eyes.

### What makes me concerned?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  As a child,
  I used to watching nature and wilderness documentaries.
  On Sundays from BBC station with [David Attenborough] as a presenter or
  narrator.
  Mostly from _"[The Blue Planet]"_ series.
  It was my sort of meditation watching the scenes of natural wilderness,
  especially with this calm voice, that kept my curiosity high and in awe.

  A few years later,
  **influenced by a [TEDx talk from Sylvia Earle],
  it got into my head how we as humans have disappointed to take better care of
  our world's blue part**.

  Since then,
  I decided to monitor the situation by following the news from the
  NGOs and other respected marine biologists.
  From what I see, there has been some progress.
  However,
  I still have lots of concerns that we are not making enough to improve it.
  It frustrates me that I'm not capable enough to help more with this case.

  I am also concerned that **I noticed an alarmingly increasing trend of
  breaking privacy rights on the Internet** with my digital marketing
  experience.
  This matter is still relatively new to me,
  and if I had to recommend where to start looking to expand this topic,
  I could recommend this one [TEDx talk from Andy Yen].
  It sparks the idea of current problems.

  For me,
  security and privacy are crucial for any organisation size now more than ever.
  I can notice that the awareness of this situation is slowly improving.
  However,
  I am not satisfied with the progress's speed because some damages may be
  irreversible.

### What is my work experience?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  After having an academic and practical experience in digital marketing,
  **I have been resiliently learning about software development, security,
  and accessibility**.
  I was mostly focusing on full-stack,
  to help small businesses adopt the technologies to their needs in a secure
  and private-oriented way.

  However, I didn't stick just to working in the IT industry.
  On the contrary.
  I volunteered on many projects since I was a student and a long member of the
  international student organisation - [AIESEC].
  I worked on farms, packhouses, warehouses.
  I did housekeeping in hospitality businesses,
  and as a kitchen porter in the restaurant.
  I have participated in help exchange quite often, mostly through [HelpX].

  Occasionally I helped remotely with graphic design errands and online
  promotion campaigns or websites development.
  I did anything to allow myself to discover as much as possible in this
  world.
  And what it has to offer.

</details>

### What type of adopter, I am?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  By standard definitions, I am **Early Adopter**.
  I don't take pride in being the first to use new technologies or products.
  I like to research them,
  try to find their potential and provide feedback.
  Naturally, I pick them with caution and understanding.
  It suits my interest in software researching.
  While I do that,
  I pay attention to privacy and security depending on the software purpose.
  
  I don't try to be an opinion leader, neither become an influencer.
  I carefully select my "own circle" of them from the IT industry and the
  marine world.
  In modern times,
  I am doing my best to not fall into the trap of being misinformed.

## My technology stack

Below you can find the technologies I am familiar by having any experience with
them.
I also allowed myself to share some thoughts about them,
mostly to remind myself why I pick these or why I use it.

    My thoughts on Linux
  </summary>

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer.
I learned more about the concept and the purpose of **[Open-source model and
open collaboration]**.
By the time I grew,
I have identified myself with the idea of this movement.
I started myself to **use only Open Source technologies or tools**,
whenever possible.
Besides that,
this platform plays a crucial role in software development and servers
administration.
For my aspirations to become a full-stack developer,
I mainly focus on this operating system.

##### Distributions

Normally, I use "headless" Linux _(via terminal)_.
I have worked with these following **distributions** so far:

###### Ubuntu

  <details>
    <summary>
      <img alt="Ubuntu logo" height="12"
           src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Logo-ubuntu_cof-orange-hex.svg"
      />
      My thoughts on Ubuntu
    </summary>

At first, in my learning journey, I started with **[Ubuntu]**.
I found it to be the most beginner-friendly one.
Now,
I am using this distribution mostly for the servers where I need to install or
configure quickly.
With the configurations made in advance, it can save some time.

  </details>

[ubuntu]: https://ubuntu.com/

###### Debian

  <details>
    <summary>
      <img alt="Debian logo" height="12"
           src="https://www.debian.org/logos/openlogo-nd.svg"
      />
      My thoughts on Debian
    </summary>

When I decided to focus on Open Source technologies only,
I picked **[Debian]** as my main distribution to use,
because it's the most common one used by other developers.
I found it easy to use with having a previous experience with `Ubuntu`.

  </details>

[debian]: https://www.debian.org/

###### Arch Linux

  <details>
    <summary>
      <img alt="ArchLinux logo" height="12"
           src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Archlinux-icon-crystal-64.svg"
      />
      My thoughts on Arch Linux
    </summary>

The deeper I dug into expanding my knowledge about Linux,
I have found out about **[Arch Linux]**.
I totally identified myself with its five principles:
simplicity, modernity, pragmatism, user centrality, and versatility.
**I am about to start using this distribution as my main one**.

  </details>

#### Windows 10

<details>
  <summary>
    <img alt="Windows logo" height="12"
         src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Windows_logo_-_2012_%28dark_blue%29.svg"
    />
    My thoughts on Windows 10
  </summary>

From time to time, when I'm in need to use Adobe tools, such as `Illustrator`,
`XD`, `Photoshop`, etc.
For now, it is impossible to use Adobe products on Linux platforms.
The replacements _(`GIMP`, `Inkscape`, etc.)_ doesn't always fulfil the job.
I had the moments when other GUI software was available only on the popular
operating systems _(Windows or Mac)_,
which gives me another reason to keep using it.
Luckily,
Microsoft had a "change of heart" in the past years with its own contributions
and focus on Open Source.
They started to care more about the developers,
and they are providing a **[Windows Subsystem for Linux]** _(`WSL`)_
environment which I use.

    My thoughts on Windows Terminal
  </summary>

On Windows 10 I use **[Windows Terminal]**.
In my opinion is the most user-friendly one, customizable,
and easy to use with any shells available on my Windows or Linux _(via `WSL`)_.

</details>

### Shells

#### Zsh

<details>
  <summary>
    <img alt="Zsh logo" height="12"
         src="https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/terminal-1-logo-svg-vector.svg"
    />
    My thoughts on Zsh
  </summary>

As the main shell for everyday tasks or projects, I use **[Zsh]**.
It's extending `Bash` with more features,
and there are lots of available Open Source tools or plugins to allow me being
more productive, with my own configurations.

</details>

[zsh]: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/

#### Bash

<details>
  <summary>
    <img alt="Bash logo" height="12"
         src="https://github.com/odb/official-bash-logo/blob/master/assets/Logos/Icons/SVG/BASH_logo-transparent-bg-bw-02.svg"
    />
    My thoughts on Bash
  </summary>

There are the moments when I use **[Bash]** as this is usually the default
shell available and when connecting to a server with Linux.
For this reason, I do my own "Shell scripting" in Bash's syntax,
because I can use it cross-shell _(with `Zsh`)_.
Another reason is that I can use [`ShellCheck`] for linting my own scripts to
deal with errors or possible security issues.

</details>

#### PowerShell

    />
    My thoughts on PowerShell
  </summary>

Once a while,
I do some automation with the files management on Windows.
Or other tasks related to the usage of this operating system.
I found **[PowerShell]** to be a perfect fit for this purpose.
I use it as well for testing projects which are supposed to be cross-platform.

</details>

### Editors

#### Neovim

<details>
  <summary>
    <img alt="Neovim logo" height="12"
         src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Neovim-mark-flat.svg"
    />
    My thoughts on Neovim
  </summary>

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**,
because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's quite fast.
With a proper configuration, it can have some IDE features.
After a few months of training,
it definitely made me more productive and less dependant on the GUI editors.

I have to warn you.
The curve in learning how to use this editor was steep for me.
It took me a while to understand this text editor,
and as well how to configure plugins on my own _(requires an understanding of
`VimScript` aka `VimL`)_. It was worth it for me!

</details>

#### Visual Studio Code

<details>
  <summary>
    <img alt="Visual Studio Code logo" height="12"
         src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg"
    />
    My thoughts on Visual Studio Code
  </summary>

For debugging purposes, I use **[Visual Studio Code]**.
Because this editor is easier to use and provides more advanced possibilities.
Sadly, at the expense of performance.
I use it also when I need to code with a quick preview of the results.
For example, an `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS, `Markdown`, etc. _(with plugins, of
course)_.

To keep the consistency, with keybindings and mappings,
in using both of mentioned editors, I use **[VSCodeVim plugin]**.
