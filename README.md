### Editors

On a daily basis, I use **[Neovim]**, because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's very fast. With a proper configuration, it can have some  IDE features, and after some time of training, it definitely made me more productive and less dependant on the GUI editors.
Although I have to warn you that the learning curve to learn how to use this editor is very steep. It takes a time to understand this editor, and as well how to configure plugins on your own _(requires an understanding of `VimScript` aka `VimL`)_.

For debugging purposes I use **[Visual Studio Code]**, because this editor is easier to use for this and is more advanced. I use it also when I need to code with a quick preview of the results. For example a `SVG` code, `HTML` & CSS, `Markdown`, etc. _(with the help of plugins)_. To keep the consistency _(with keybindings and mappings)_ in using both of these editors, I use **[VSCodeVim plugin]**.
