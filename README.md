## üßë‚ÄçüíªAbout me

As my short biography says, I'm a **concerned Global Citizen** passionate about
life below the oceans, because of this also about sustainable development.\
Since a while,
I have dug myself into the topic of **digital privacy rights on the Internet**.
That includes protecting ourselves and the small businesses who are
unconsciously at risk.

Below I will share a little more about me in
<abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> format.

### Why a Global Citizen?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Because I do explore the world as much as possible.
  As [Thor Heyerdahl] once said:

  > Borders? I have never seen one.\
  > But I have heard they exist‚Ä¶ in the minds of some people.

  Like him, **I don't see the borders**.
  I was born in Poland, but my home is Earth,
  and I care about the entire planet.
  I treat every habitant equally without any discrimination.
  I have been living in Poland, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Ireland.
  I don't plan to stop discovering other cultures and their lifestyles anytime
  soon.
  Is quite astonishing to me,
  how little I knew,
  if I didn't start to experience with my own eyes.

### What makes me concerned?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  As a child,
  I used to watching nature and wilderness documentaries.
  On Sundays from BBC station with [David Attenborough] as a presenter or
  narrator.
  Mostly from _"[The Blue Planet]"_ series.
  It was my sort of meditation watching the scenes of natural wilderness,
  especially with this calm voice, that kept my curiosity high and in awe.

  A few years later,
  **influenced by a [TEDx talk from Sylvia Earle],
  it got into my head how we as humans have disappointed to take better care of
  our world's blue part**.

  Since then,
  I decided to monitor the situation by following the news from the
  NGOs and other respected marine biologists.
  From what I see, there has been some progress.
  However,
  I still have lots of concerns that we are not making enough to improve it.
  It frustrates me that I'm not capable enough to help more with this case.

  I am also concerned that **I noticed an alarmingly increasing trend of
  breaking privacy rights on the Internet** with my digital marketing
  experience.
  This matter is still relatively new to me,
  and if I had to recommend where to start looking to expand this topic,
  I could recommend this one [TEDx talk from Andy Yen].
  It sparks the idea of current problems.

  For me,
  security and privacy are crucial for any organisation size now more than ever.
  I can notice that the awareness of this situation is slowly improving.
  However,
  I am not satisfied with the progress's speed because some damages may be
  irreversible.

</details>

### What is my work experience?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  After having an academic and practical experience in digital marketing,
  **I have been resiliently learning about software development, security,
  and accessibility**.
  I was mostly focusing on full-stack,
  to help small businesses adopt the technologies to their needs in a secure
  and private-oriented way.

  However, I didn't stick just to working in the IT industry.
  On the contrary.
  I volunteered on many projects since I was a student and a long member of the
  international student organisation - [AIESEC].
  I worked on farms, packhouses, warehouses.
  I did housekeeping in hospitality businesses,
  and as a kitchen porter in the restaurant.
  I have participated in help exchange quite often, mostly through [HelpX].

  Occasionally I helped remotely with graphic design errands and online
  promotion campaigns or websites development.
  I did anything to allow myself to discover as much as possible in this
  world.
  And what it has to offer.

</details>

### What type of adopter, I am?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  By standard definitions, I am **Early Adopter**.
  I don't take pride in being the first to use new technologies or products.
  I like to research them,
  try to find their potential and provide feedback.
  Naturally, I pick them with caution and understanding.
  It suits my interest in software researching.
  While I do that,
  I pay attention to privacy and security depending on the software purpose.
  
  I don't try to be an opinion leader, neither become an influencer.
  I carefully select my _"own circle"_ of them from the
  <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> industry and the
  marine world.
  In modern times,
  I am doing my best to not fall into the trap of being misinformed.

## üíªMy technology stack

At the beginnings of my journey to become a developer.
I learned more about the concept and the purpose of [Open-source model and
open collaboration].
By the time I grew, I have identified myself with this movement's idea.
**I started using Open Source technologies or tools, whenever possible**.

Below you can find the technologies I am familiar with by having any experience.
I also allowed myself to share some thoughts about them,
mostly to remind myself why I pick these or why I use it.

### Operating systems

I have experience with two popular operating systems.
[Linux] and [Windows].
I wanted to be oriented in both systems,
to be more flexible with what resources I have available,
at any time.

[Windows]: #windows
[Linux]: #linux

**üîóQuick navigation for operating systems:**

- [Linux](#linux)
  - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)
  - [Debian](#debian)

#### Linux

<img alt="Linux icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/linux.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Linux</summary>

  **This platform plays a crucial role in software development and servers
  administration**.
  For my aspirations to become a full-stack developer,
  I mainly focus on this operating system.
  Because this one is a [UNIX-like] system,
  I don't leave myself utterly unprepared for working with macOS or some
  electronic devices, including smartphones.

  Usually, I use Linux `"headless"` _(via terminal)_.
  I have worked with below-described **distributions** so far.

  [UNIX-like]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like
</details>

##### Ubuntu

<img alt="Ubuntu icon"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/ubuntu.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Ubuntu</summary>

  At the beginning of my learning journey,
  I started with [Ubuntu].
  I found it to be the most beginner-friendly one.
  Now,
  **I am using this distribution mostly for the servers** where I need to
  install or configure quickly.
  With easy access to the available resources and provided tools in advance,
  it can save time.

  [Ubuntu]: https://ubuntu.com/
</details>

##### Debian

<img alt="Debian icon"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/debian.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Debian</summary>

  When I decided to focus more on Open Source technologies only,
  I started to work with [Debian], especially on my Raspberry Pi.
  Thanks to the previous experience with `Ubuntu`,
  I was able to find myself in it.
  And learn more about the history behind it,
  because it helps to understand other Debian-like distributions.

  [Debian]: https://www.debian.org/
</details>

##### Kali Linux

<img alt="Kali Linux icon"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/kali-linux.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Kali Linux</summary>

  Because I use <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> on Windows,
  I decided to use this one distribution as the main one.
  [Kali Linux] provides the configured and installed tools for advanced
  penetration testing.
  Experience from `Debian` helped to get started with this one.
  It also offers `Win-Kex` tool,
  which allows using Linux and Windows application, at the same time.\
  This combination allows me to study better the differences between these
  operating systems.
  And of course,
  do some coding or software researching,
  without worrying about any tool working only on the specific operating system.
  Performance is still an issue,
  but I found it acceptable for not so _"resource-consuming"_ tasks.

</details>

##### Arch Linux

<img alt="Arch Linux icon"
     height="25"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/arch-linux.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Arch Linux</summary>

  The deeper I dug into expanding my knowledge about Linux,
  I have found out about [Arch Linux].
  I totally identified myself with its five principles:
  simplicity,
  modernity,
  pragmatism,
  user centrality,
  and versatility.\
  **I'm about to start using this distribution as my main one for the
  development**.
  I am still in the learning process.

  [Arch Linux]: https://www.archlinux.org/
</details>

#### Windows

<img alt="Windows icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/windows10.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Windows 10</summary>

  Since Microsoft has changed its philosophy - _"to focus more on open-source"_,
  they started to care more about the developers' experience.
  By providing tools such as [Windows Terminal], [Windows Subsystem for Linux],
  <abbr title="Visual Studio Code">VSCode</abbr> editor, etc.
  With the power of Open source,
  they managed to fix many faults,
  making it a much more friendly system for the coders.

  However,
  **this system's default settings, bloatware,
  manipulative marketing patterns and confusing approach to user's privacy
  still leave many areas to improve and leaves me concerned and suspicious**.
  No matter how comfortable using this system matures,
  I will keep my alert and suspiciousness,
  to any new features or tools.

  For the reason that is the most commonly used operating system,
  I use it to be more resourceful for the average user or any small company.
  Another reason is that some existing professional
  <abbr title="graphical user interface">GUI</abbr> software tools are
  available for this system only,
  such as Adobe tools.

### Shells

I found it impossible to omit understanding how the shells work in depth.
I believe this is where I should have started when I decided to down this road
of learning software development.
It wasn't easy to figure out and navigate through the differences between
Linux and Windows shells.
After continuous learning and many trails and trying to solve the errors,
I can't live without them.

It feels quite good and bizarre to be no longer dependant on
<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> tools.
Instead,
I fell in love with <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> tools and
shell scripting to automate most of my tasks.
**Experience from studying shells' s was a significant boost to my
productivity, resourcefulness and knowledge about the software environments**.

**üîóQuick navigation for shells:**

- [Bash](#bash)
- [Zsh](#zsh)
- [PowerShell](#powershell)

#### Bash

<img alt="Bash icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/bash.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Bash</summary>

  [Bash] was the **most important** to get comfortable with during the study
  process.
  To my knowledge,
  it comes as default one in UNIX-like operating systems.
  For this reason,
  I do my own _"shell scripting"_ in Bash's syntax,
  for the tasks automation,
  because I can use it cross-shell on Linux _(with `Zsh` for example).
  Another definite plus for me was that I could use [ShellCheck] for linting my
  scripts to deal with errors or possible security issues.

  [Bash]: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/
  [ShellCheck]: https://www.shellcheck.net/
</details>

#### Zsh

<img alt="Zsh icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/zsh-unofficial.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Zsh</summary>

  For the development, as the main shell, I use [Zsh].
  It's extending `Bash` with more features,
  and **there are lots of available Open Source tools or plugins to enhance
  productivity**.
  There are some small differences in syntax,
  and sadly, there's no linter for this shell scripts.
  Luckily,
  the experience from `Bash` didn't stop me from improving my shell experience
  with my custom configuration.

  [Zsh]: http://zsh.sourceforge.net/
</details>

#### PowerShell

<img alt="PowerShell icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/powershell.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on PowerShell</summary>

  Since I use Windows,
  sometimes I want to create some automation scripts for
  this system environment, on the [PowerShell].
  It has more verbose syntax,
  which makes the purpose of the code more understandable.
  It is quite extensive,
  and it is possible to do almost everything in its operating system.

  While there's a possibility to use
  <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> _(with `Bash` or
  `Zsh`)_ instead,
  it didn't provide that much performance as PowerShell did _(for the
  front-end development)_.
  There are some _"gotchas"_ of using WSL, and it has limitations.
  However,
  with the experience from Linux,
  the syntax difference it created a lot of confusion for me.
  Another downside for me was that the configuration process wasn't an easy one.
  Surprisingly,
  my developing experience using this shell wasn't that irritating,
  given that it doesn't have a vast community that supports it.
  It was worth it for me to learn it because now I am more manageable with this
  knowledge and experience.
  It did speed up doing the tasks on Windows by simply using the terminal.

### Editors

My favourite editors, I use, like my own swiss-army knife.

**üîóQuick navigation for editors:**

- [Neovim](#neovim)

#### Neovim

<img alt="Neovim icon"

     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/neovim.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Neovim</summary>

  Daily, I use [Neovim].
  Because I can use it directly from the terminal and it's very fast.
  After a few months of training, it made me more productive.\
  The curve in learning how to use this editor was steep for me.
  It took me a while to understand this text editor,
  and as well how to configure plugins on my own _(requires an understanding
  of VimScript aka `VimL`)_.

  When I connect _(for example via SSH)_ to any device via terminal,
  which doesn't have any of my custom configurations,
  all I need is to use `vi` or `vim` to edit the file quickly.
  **This editor saved a great deal of my time, on Windows and Linux**.

#### Visual Studio Code

<img alt="Visual Studio Code icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/vscode.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Visual Studio Code</summary>

  I use [Visual Studio Code] _(aka `VSCode`)_ mostly for debugging purposes
  because this editor is easier to use and provides more advanced
  possibilities.
  Sadly,
  at the expense of performance.

  It is also great when I need to put all of the used tools and
  configurations in one place,
  to have a bigger picture of the project's entire environment.
  A rich plugin system and active community allowed me to manage it from one
  editor.

  To keep the consistency, with keybindings and mappings, in using both of
  mentioned editors, I use [VSCodeVim plugin].

#### JavaScript

<img alt="JavaScript icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/javascript.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on JavaScript</summary>

  [JavaScript] is the programming language, where I feel the most confident.
  Because I was working on the website's projects in my digital marketing
  experience, I couldn't skip understanding the basics. From a time
  perspective, it's astounding how this most popular language has matured
  over the years. While it may not be the most performant one, it is the most
  flexible in building a website application.

  While JavaScript still grows very dynamically,
  **it was crucial to me to understand the _"vanilla"_ JavaScript, as the
  frameworks and libraries are constantly changing over the years,
  even months**.
  It was pointless to pick one and stick to it,
  without understanding how it works behind the scenes. \
  I studied intensely to understand the JavaScript _"gotchas"_,
  its limitations, and how it works differently compared to other languages.
  Now,
  I can pick a suitable toolset to adapt to the project(s) needs,
  instead of blindly favouring one over another.

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Python</summary>

  When I engaged myself more in software research,
  I needed knowledge on how other programming languages work.
  I picked [Python] because it was very mature,
  could be used with front-end.
  Another reason was that it handles I/O (Input/Output) and multi-threading.
  Frankly, those terms I kept reading or hearing and made me confused.
  I barely fully understood what it meant.
  Learning and understanding Python environment filled the gap for me.

  It was easy for me to code in it,
  but I sometimes felt trapped with different mental models from the
  JavaScript experience.
  **This language gave me an important lesson.
  Writing the code more verbose and straightforward to understand is better
  than just trying to be cool with tricks,
  which may confuse the other developers proficient in a different
  programming language.**
  And with that in mind,
  they know the different syntax.
  This language is way more flexible than JavaScript.
  It unlocks the capabilities to build stuff not limited to only the website
  applications but also electronic devices _(like Raspberry Pi)_ or data
  management.

#### Rust

<img alt="Rust icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/rust.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on Rust</summary>

  **I aspire to learn [Rust]!**\
  In software researching process,
  learning tools I didn't miss the tools written in Rust language.
  I couldn't help but notice how very performant they were!
  And reliable too.

  I love using CLI tools,
  so I want to expand my skills by learning how to write in Rust,
  then I can help by collaborating on existing open-source projects.
  I am sure Rust environment can help improve the project(s)' performance by
  fully utilizing its available resources.

  Alright.
  When I wrote these thoughts,
  I motivated myself to start.
  Now.
  To understand the basics and get familiar with the syntax.
  This part may change soon.

#### C++

<img alt="C++ icon"
     height="50"
     src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeho91/.dotfiles/main/Media/Icons/c++.svg"
/>

<details>
  <summary>My thoughts on C++</summary>

  During my studies, I attended the courses on programming in [C++].
  I may have passed the tests and got grades from it; I didn't understand it.
  For what is worth,
  the most important concepts I gained from it are the types, classes,
  polymorphism, but I got lost in the abstractions.
  I should have been more prepared with preliminary knowledge,
  especially about the shells and operating systems.
  Directly starting from this language, that was too overwhelming.
  It ruined my interest in programming for a quite while.

  However,
  **the distant memory from learning this programming language still helps me
  understand the algorithms' core parts and follow the logic while reading
  the code**.
  Without it,
  I probably would struggle more to understand JavaScript more deeply.
