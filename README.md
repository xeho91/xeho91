## üßë About me

I'm a **concerned Global Citizen** passionate about life below the oceans,
because of this also about sustainable development.\
For a while,
I have dug myself into the topic of **digital privacy rights on the Internet**.
That includes protecting ourselves and the small businesses that are
unconsciously at risk.

Below I will share a little more about me in
<abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr> format.

**üîóQuick navigation for about me:**

### Why a Global Citizen?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Because I do explore the world as much as possible.
  As [Thor Heyerdahl] once said:

  > Borders? I have never seen one.\
  > But I have heard they exist‚Ä¶ in the minds of some people.

  Like him, **I don't see the borders**.
  I was born in Poland, but my home is Earth,
  and I care about the entire planet.
  I treat every habitant equally without any discrimination.
  I have been living in Poland, Brazil, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Ireland.
  I don't plan to stop discovering other cultures and their lifestyles anytime
  soon.
  Is quite astonishing to me,
  how little I knew,
  if I didn't start to experience with my own eyes.

### What makes me concerned?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  As a child,
  I used to watching nature and wilderness documentaries.
  On Sundays from BBC station with [David Attenborough] as a presenter or
  narrator.
  Mostly from _"[The Blue Planet]"_ series.
  It was my sort of meditation watching the scenes of natural wilderness,
  especially with this calm voice, that kept my curiosity high and in awe.

  A few years later,
  **influenced by a [TEDx talk from Sylvia Earle],
  it got into my head how we as humans have disappointed to take better care of
  our world's blue part**.

  Since then,
  I decided to monitor the situation by following the news from the
  NGOs and other respected marine biologists.
  From what I see, there has been some progress.
  However,
  I still have lots of concerns that we are not making enough to improve it.
  It frustrates me that I'm not capable enough to help more with this case.

  I am also concerned that **I noticed an alarmingly increasing trend of
  breaking privacy rights on the Internet** with my digital marketing
  experience.
  This matter is still relatively new to me,
  and if I had to recommend where to start looking to expand this topic,
  I could recommend this one [TEDx talk from Andy Yen].
  It sparks the idea of current problems.

  For me,
  security and privacy are crucial for any organisation size now more than ever.
  I can notice that the awareness of this situation is slowly improving.
  However,
  I am not satisfied with the progress's speed because some damages may be
  irreversible.

### What is my work experience?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  After having an academic and practical experience in digital marketing,
  **I have been resiliently learning about software development, security,
  and accessibility**.
  I was mostly focusing on full-stack,
  to help small businesses adopt the technologies to their needs in a secure
  and private-oriented way.

  However, I didn't stick just to working in the IT industry.
  On the contrary.
  I volunteered on many projects since I was a student and a long member of the
  international student organisation - [AIESEC].
  I worked on farms, packhouses, warehouses.
  I did housekeeping in hospitality businesses,
  and as a kitchen porter in the restaurant.
  I have participated in help exchange quite often, mostly through [HelpX].

  Occasionally I helped remotely with graphic design errands and online
  promotion campaigns or websites development.
  I did anything to allow myself to discover as much as possible in this
  world.
  And what it has to offer.

### What type of adopter am I?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  By standard definitions, I am **Early Adopter**.
  I don't take pride in being the first to use new technologies or products.
  I like to research them,
  try to find their potential and provide feedback.
  Naturally, I pick them with caution and understanding.
  It suits my interest in software researching.
  While I do that,
  I pay attention to privacy and security depending on the software purpose.
  
  I don't try to be an opinion leader, neither become an influencer.
  I carefully select my _"own circle"_ of them from the
  <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> industry and the
  marine world.
  In modern times,
  I am doing my best to not fall into the trap of being misinformed.
